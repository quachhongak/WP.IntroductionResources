# WP.IntroductionResources

## Key concepts

- **[WordPress Core Architecture](#WordPress-core-architecture)**: Understanding the core architecture, including the main directories (wp-admin, wp-includes, wp-content), core files, and how WordPress serves content.

- **[Themes](#Theme-development) and [Plugins](#plugins)**: Knowledge of how to create and customize themes and plugins, including understanding the template hierarchy, hooks (actions and filters), and the WordPress Loop.

- **[Custom Post Types and Taxonomies](#Custom-Post-Types-and-Taxonomies)**: Creating custom post types and taxonomies to extend WordPress content management capabilities beyond posts and pages.

- **[WordPress REST API](#wordpress-rest-api)**: Utilizing the WordPress REST API for creating custom endpoints or interfacing WordPress with external applications, allowing for headless CMS architectures.

- **Security and Performance Optimization**: Implementing best practices for securing WordPress sites, including data validation/sanitization, and strategies for optimizing site performance (caching, database optimization, image compression). ==> **_This is usually PhiLac that manages that part so you have less to worry here_**

- **[Docker+WorPress](Docker+WordPress)**. To ease the development process, having docker as part of the tooling could be quite important.

## WordPress core architecture

Most of the work will likely be done in the wp-content/theme folder while creating our own theme. It would happen that for certain project, we need to create our own plugin OR extension for the wp-admin.

Most of the content and the best resource is the WordPress developer resource [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/)

One of the most common resource used is the page hierachy form WordPress. So you can refer to this link [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)

## Theme development

Creating a theme in WordPress allows for unparalleled customization and control over a website's appearance and functionality, enabling developers and designers to craft unique user experiences tailored to specific needs or branding requirements. A custom theme can integrate specific design elements, functionality, and optimizations that pre-built themes may not offer, providing a more cohesive and optimized user experience. Additionally, developing a theme from scratch or customizing an existing one helps in understanding WordPress's core functionality and architecture, enhancing one's skills in web development within the WordPress ecosystem.

However, there are several "gotchas" to be mindful of. Ensuring compatibility with the latest WordPress core updates is crucial to maintain the site's functionality and security. Developers must adhere to WordPress coding standards and best practices to ensure their theme is efficient, secure, and scalable. Over-customization without proper enqueueing of scripts and styles can lead to conflicts with plugins and core updates. Lastly, neglecting responsive design or accessibility standards can severely impact user experience and site performance. Balancing custom functionality with performance optimization and maintaining code readability and documentation are key considerations for successful WordPress theme development.

## Plugins

A majority of the sites we build would be using a combination of the below plugins as a "Core" set of plugins for development.

- **ACF and ACF PRO**: Enhances WordPress with advanced custom fields and powerful field management.

- **Elementor**: A drag-and-drop page builder for WordPress, enabling easy site design.

- **WPBakery**: A page builder plugin for WordPress, offering front-end and back-end editing.

- **Contact Form 7**: Simple but flexible contact form plugin, with customizable form and mail content.

- **Yoast**: A comprehensive SEO plugin, offering analysis and optimization for WordPress content.

### Other used plugins

- **WPML**: A plugin enabling multilingual content management in WordPress, supporting translations across posts, pages, and taxonomies.

- **WP Multisite**: A WordPress feature that allows multiple virtual sites to share a single WordPress installation.

## Custom Post Types and Taxonomies

On most projects, we need to define custom post types to store specific bits of data (news, resources, recipes, locations...). Therefore understanding how to create, organize, store and interact with custom post types is **_very important_**

- **Using the WordPress `register_post_type()` and `register_taxonomy()` Functions**: Directly use WordPress's built-in functions in your theme's `functions.php` file or within a custom plugin to programmatically define custom post types and taxonomies.

- **Using a Plugin**: Utilize plugins like "Custom Post Type UI," "Toolset Types," or "Pods" to create and manage custom post types and taxonomies through a user-friendly interface without writing code.

- **Theme Integration**: Integrate custom post types and taxonomies directly into a theme, ensuring they are part of the theme's core functionality, offering a seamless experience tailored to the theme's design and purpose.

Two approaches that we usually prefer when it comes down to:

1. Register the post type using Custom Post Type UI and then create the post type fields in ACF
2. Register the post type directly in ACF and create the post type fields in ACF

But we would adapt this strategy based of: if we are creating a NET NEW SITE or INHERIT/MAINTAINING an existing site.

## WordPress REST API

The WordPress REST API is a powerful tool that enables developers to interact with WordPress sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. This API facilitates the development of headless WordPress architectures, where the backend (WordPress) is decoupled from the frontend presentation layer, allowing developers to use any technology stack for the frontend while leveraging WordPress's robust content management capabilities in the backend.

This API facilitates the development of headless WordPress architectures, where the backend (WordPress) is decoupled from the frontend presentation layer, allowing developers to use any technology stack for the frontend while leveraging WordPress's robust content management capabilities in the backend.

### Advantages:

- **Flexibility**: Enables the use of WordPress as a headless CMS with any frontend technology.
- **Accessibility**: Simplifies external applications' access to WordPress content and functionalities.
- **Development Efficiency**: Streamlines the development process, offering standardized endpoints for posts, users, categories, etc.

### Inconveniences:

- **Security Concerns**: Exposes a public API that could be a target for unauthorized access if not properly secured.
- **Complexity**: Requires a good understanding of RESTful principles and authentication mechanisms.
- **Performance**: Can introduce additional latency, especially if not properly cached or optimized, due to the overhead of HTTP requests.

## Docker+Wordpress

Using Docker for WordPress development offers an efficient, scalable, and consistent environment for building and testing websites. It simplifies the process of configuring development environments, ensuring that developers can work in an isolated setup that mirrors production settings without the hassle of manual configurations. Docker containers can run WordPress, associated services like MySQL and PHP, and tools for development and debugging, ensuring compatibility across different machines and teams. This approach reduces "it works on my machine" problems, streamlining development, testing, and deployment processes across various environments.
